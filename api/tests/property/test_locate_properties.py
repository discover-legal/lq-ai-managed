"""Citation-locator offset property tests — DE-230.

Two locators feed verified citations:

* :func:`app.citation.extraction.locate_in_chunk` — RAG citations;
  offsets into the chunk content string.
* :func:`app.citation.caselaw.locate_passage` — caselaw blockquotes;
  offsets into the opinion text.

Offsets become highlight spans and audit-trail evidence, so the
contract under test is: whenever a locator returns ``(start, end)``,
the offsets are in-bounds, and — for the verbatim paths — the text at
those offsets IS the quote. A locator that returns plausible-but-wrong
offsets would attach a lawyer's citation to the wrong passage while
still "verifying" it.
